# bq-utils

## Overview
`bq-utils` is a set of functions that allow you to do stuff with bigquery such as

- Write a table or query to CSV
- Write a set of tables/queries to an excel spreadsheet with a sheet per query result
- Due to composability, most functions and features are exported. I give no guarantees to maintain compatibility, so please use a dependency manager to pin a version to make sure I don't break your builds!

## Install
